This is a wordpress website... i made my own post types and custom plugins for the user. 
the user can update new listings with images and info about the house...
also the user can update real estate agents (images and agent info)...
this is made with html, css, css grid, bootstrap, and php...
I plan to add search capabilities using javascript filter....
